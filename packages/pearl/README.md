# Pearl

Pearl is a small framework for creating video games in the browser. It's written in TypeScript, but can be used in any language that compiles to JavaScript.

Pearl is a rewrite of [Coquette](http://coquette.maryrosecook.com/). Unlike Coquette, Pearl is built with TypeScript and ES6 classes in mind. Currently the API is just about the same outside a couple of changes to make things more TypeScript-friendly, but I reckon it'll end up deviating quite a bit from Coquette's original design as things progress.

## View Examples

Run:

```
npm install

```

and open `example/simple/index.html` in your browser.
